# Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Kernel Methods

This repository provides an introduction to Support Vector Classification (SVC), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and various SVM kernels for machine learning tasks. These algorithms are widely used for both classification and regression tasks, and the choice of kernel can significantly impact their performance. This README will give you an overview of these topics and provide resources for further exploration.

## Support Vector Classification (SVC)

Support Vector Classification (SVC) is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It aims to find a hyperplane that best separates different classes in the data, while maximizing the margin between them. This hyperplane is determined by support vectors, the data points closest to the decision boundary. SVC is effective for both linearly separable and non-linearly separable datasets.

## Support Vector Regression (SVR)

Support Vector Regression (SVR) is an extension of SVM for regression tasks. Instead of classifying data points into categories, SVR aims to find a regression function that best fits the data while minimizing the margin violation. SVR is robust to outliers and can handle non-linear relationships between input features and the target variable.

## SVM Kernels

SVM Kernels are essential components of SVM algorithms, allowing them to handle non-linearly separable data. Kernels transform the input data into a higher-dimensional space, where a linear hyperplane can effectively separate the classes. Common kernels include:
- **Linear Kernel:** Suitable for linearly separable data.
- **Polynomial Kernel:** Useful for capturing polynomial relationships in the data.
- **Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel:** Effective for non-linear data with complex decision boundaries.
